Linear regression is one of the most basic statistical models out there, its results can be interpreted by almost everyone, and it has been around since the 19th century. This is precisely what makes linear regression so popular. It’s simple, and it has survived for hundreds of years. Even though it is not as sophisticated as other algorithms like artificial neural networks or random forests, according to a survey made by KD Nuggets, regression was the algorithm most used by data scientists in 2016 and 2017. It’s even predicted it will still be used in the year 2118!
